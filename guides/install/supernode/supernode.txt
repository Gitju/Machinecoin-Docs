If you own a server and want to strengthen the Machinecoin network you can become a supernode.

1. Download and install the latest version of Machinecoin from the official Machinecoin.org homepage. You will just need to install the Machinecoin-Daemon and setup the basic machinecoin.conf that you also would use as a normal user.

2. Then edit machinecoin.conf and add
[code]# If you just want to run a relay and no wallet this saves RAM
disablewallet=1
# If you have plenty RAM and bandwidth you can increase the number of connections
maxconnections=500
#bloomfilter
bloomfilters=1
#maxsendbuffer
maxsendbuffer=256000
#maxreceivebuffer
maxreceivebuffer=256000
[/code]

3. (optional!) The following Linux iptables rules limits the number of connections to
   TCP port 40333 per IP address and per /24 subnet.  This protects against
   a connection exhaustion DoS attack.  If you have lots of RAM and bandwidth
   you can increase these limits.

[code]# Allow eight connections per IPv4 /24 subnet
-A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 40333 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 8 --connlimit-mask 24 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
# Allow two connection per IPv4 address
-A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 40333 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 2 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
# Allow TCP connection if not rejected by the previous limit
-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 40333 -j ACCEPT[/code]

4. (optional!) Edit machinecoin.conf and add one (not more, no need for!) other supernode 
[code]#other supernode
addnode=ADDRESS[/code]
from the list of supernodes (ADDRESSES):
178.62.174.65
5.101.97.201
5.196.8.205
macpi.machinecoin.de
mine.scryptpower.de
