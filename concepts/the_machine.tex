\section{Introduction}

\frame
{   
In November 2008, a paper titled ``Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System'' was posted on The Cryptography Mailing List at metzdowd.com. It was written by either a person or group with the pseudonymous ``Satoshi Nakamoto''. In this paper methods of using a peer-to-peer network to generate a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust were described in detail.
\newline
\newline
\visible<2->{\texttt{``A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.''}
  \vskip5mm
  \hspace*\fill{\small--- Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\footnote{http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf}}}
}

\frame
{   
In January 2009, these methods came into existence through the release of the first open source Bitcoin client and the issuance of the first bitcoins, with Satoshi Nakamoto, mining the first block of bitcoins, which at this time had a reward of 50 bitcoins. 
\newline
\newline
\visible<2->{In the beginning the values of the first bitcoin transactions were negotiated by individuals on the bitcointalk forums with for example one notable transaction involving a pizza for 10,000 bitcoins\footnote{https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0}.}
\newline
\newline
\visible<3->{These transactions provided a good evidence that it is not just in theory but also in practice possible to have a purely peer-to-peer electronic cash without the need to go through a financial institution.}
}

\frame
{   
Since then a lot of alternative cryptocurrencies have been created. All or most of them are working on the same basis just as Bitcoin does but with slightly different algorithms for special tasks.  
\newline
\newline
\visible<2->{So in general nothing seems to may have changed despite one thing: the major of the cryptoscene has turned cryptocurrencies away from being electronic cash into something that could be better described as classical currency slaves.}
\newline
\newline
\visible<3->{This means that their ``values''\footnote{http://gitju.github.io/Machinecoin.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/value.pdf} are rather determined by exchange rates than by real available products or services which a (crypto)currency originally is made for and therefore the cryptoscene has lost the path.}
}

\frame
{
So lets go back to basic and have a look at the primary function of any given (crypto)currency:
\newline
\setbeamercovered{transparent}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item<2-> A (crypto)currency is a medium that makes exchanges of products and/or services between two parties (buyer/seller) possible ...
\item<3-> ... even if the one who is the buyer has got no product and/or service available ...
\item<4-> ... that the seller would like to have and the buyer would like to give in exchange for it
\end{enumerate} 
\ 
\newline
\visible<5->{To focus on this we have decided to model a complete self-contained cryptographic ecosphere driven by nothing but the Machinecoin cryptocurrency.}

%The simpliest form of life that we actually know is known to be cells which consists of DNA (information storage) and other functional operation units that interact %with their environment and partially are also able to change their DNA itself.

\item 1 or more Machine operator(s)

The DNA stands for all the informations that are necessary to let \texttt{The Machine} work. At least this is simply the Machinecoin source code and its build instructions, the block chain plus any apps, texts, graphics and everything else that was created especially just for the Machinecoin but in general also for \texttt{The Machine} and that all can be downloaded within just a few clicks by anyone and entirely for free from the internet\footnote{github.com/Gitju?tab=repositories}.

\subsubsection{DNA}
\frame
{
The DNA is our central information storage of the complete ecosphere of  \texttt{The Machine}. Instead of four nucleobases like this is well known for example for human DNA we just use two which we have defined to be $$1$$ and $$0.$$As because classical computers also use such a binary storage model any kind of data that is stored inside a DNA can easily be copied on any classical computer or the other way round.

\subsubsection{Machine operator(s)}
\frame
{
\texttt{The Machine} operators are those who make a blanket rotate or work. They are also able to convert the blanket into a special gear just by changing their actions.

\begin{itemize}
\item{\texttt{The Machine} is a complete self-contained cryptographic ecosphere driven by nothing but the Machinecoin cryptocurrency which is completely able to substitute any other well known classical (crypto)currency\footnote{machinecoin.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/value.pdf}.}
\item{Everybody can instantly and by themself become a new machinist and through this form his own blanket either alone or together with some friends and take part in the global \texttt{The Machine} movement.}
\item{Those who want to actively take part in the further development of \texttt{The Machine} movement can become a special gear inside of the community and help to make it even more better with every new day.}

%\frametitle{Summary}
Get started with the Machinecoin and join the global \texttt{The Machine} movement. All you need to do this is: you. Just either compile the given source code located at GitHub\footnote{github.com/gitju/machinecoin} or grab one of the already pre-compiled packages from the official Machinecoin website or any other Machinecoin Community Website\footnote{machinecoin.org (.de, .tk, .in, .tk, .eu, ...)} and configure it accordingly to your needs. You may also can get started just by using the Machinecoin Paper Wallet\footnote{paper.machinecoin.org} which allows you to create your very own Machinecoin address just within a couple of seconds.
